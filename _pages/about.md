# 关于本网站

Our website is based on the open source templates designed and shared by the labs of [Sanders Lab](https://sanderslab.github.io/). We downloaded source codes from their repository and modified our contents based on shared templates. We greatly thank for allowing reuse of their codebase. 

The website is deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/BIPL-UoL/BIPL-UoL.github.io) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/BIPL-UoL/). Please feel free to reuse this code (making sure to cite the Bedford lab and Drummond lab as the original sources of the lab website template).
