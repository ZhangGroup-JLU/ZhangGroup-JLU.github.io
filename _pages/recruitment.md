## 博士后研究员招募令

We have more data and research ideas than trainees, so are keen to recruit exceptional researchers. The lab offers a collaborative and supportive environment and has a strong track record in helping students develop and begin their own independent research careers. The lab has expertise in high-performance computing and analytical pipelines, allowing novel analytic methods to be performed at scale. We are currently looking for researchers with a strong computational background in:

- Fundamental understanding and modelling of biomedical signals;
- Application-driven development in collaboration with professionals in medicine and biology.   

If you are interested, please contact Prof. Zhou directly using the details on his [UoL profile page](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/informatics/people/huiyu-zhou).
