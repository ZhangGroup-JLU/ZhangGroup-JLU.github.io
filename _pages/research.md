## Automated analysis of housing construction progress through remote sensing

<div style="text-align: justify">
This project aims at developing and testing image processing tools specifically designed to map the various development stage of new housing sites. Leveraging the short revisit time allowed by existing constellation of satellites like e.g. Planet, this will potentially allow the accurate identification of construction timeline. The specific questions the project will investigate are: Can we detect different stages of construction from high resolution satellite imagery? What are the stages of construction that we can detect and what levels of confidence can we attach? Would the solution be cost effective? As this is primarily driven by the cost of commercial satellite imagery, which is essentially determined by ground resolution, this actually means: what is the minimum ground resolution allowing the detection of construction stages? Is it necessary/desirable to know in advance where construction is expected to take place? How does this affect the prediction confidence? Could this be used to detect potential unauthorised construction activity?
