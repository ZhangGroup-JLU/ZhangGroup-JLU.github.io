**BIPL(Biomedical Image Processing Lab)** mainly works on the development of novel algorithms and application tools for automated processing of medical and biological signals/images. Major research contribution is made towards two complementary aspects: Fundamental understanding and modelling of images and signals, and Application-driven development in collaboration with professionals in medicine, biology, psychology, engineering, physics, earth observation and sociology. 
With digital biomedical signals/images being widely stored and shared in networks, the research group also looks to bolster the analysis of biomedical data and cyber-security of signal processing systems.

There are four main areas of research:

1.	**Medical signal analysis**
2.	**Animal modelling**
3.	**Remote sensing**
4.	**Cyber-security**

### Technologies and methods
The Sanders Lab is primarily a bioinformatic group that uses a wide range of genomic, bioinformatic, and statistical methods including: whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, de novo mutation detection, RNA-Seq, and ChIP-Seq.

### Collaborators
We work with closely with numerous collaborators, including the [State Lab](https://www.mstatelab.com/) and [Bender Lab](https://benderlab.ucsf.edu/lab-members) at UCSF, the [Devlin Lab](https://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/about-us/our-people/faculty/bernie-j-devlin-phd) at UPMC, the [Roeder Lab](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~roeder/) at Carnegie Mellon, the [Sestan Lab](http://medicine.yale.edu/lab/sestan/index.aspx), and the [Talkowski lab](http://talkowski.mgh.harvard.edu/) at Harvard.
